We added a third parameter, z, to the program (where z is a linear combination of variables x and y, z = Wx + Vy + b). We commented all lines that plot the training set, and only plot the training loss and testing loss when the algorithm completes. 

The program will attempt to minimize the squared mean of z_batch - z_predicted (batchloss). 

We modified the generation of the training and testing sets, such that they were not the same.
We added a quadratic relationship between y and x for the generation of the testing set. 
 
For the training-set generation: 
x = np.random.normal(0, 0.55)
y = 0.1x + 0.3 + np.random.normal(0, 0.05)
z = 0.2x + 0.4y + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)

For the testing-set generation: 
x = np.random.normal(0, 0.55)
y = 0.1x^2 + 0.3 + np.random.normal(0, 0.15) 
z = 0.4y + np.random.normal(0, 0.1) 

Each time we ran the program, the training loss was lower than the testing loss for each step. We expected this outcome--the testing set generation differed to the training set generation.
